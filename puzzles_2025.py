At 0500 hours, Agent Frostbyte went rogue. He has executed \"The Great Stocking Scandal,\" seizing all Class-A Holiday Assets and vanishing into the shadows.

Intel suggests the rogue operative known as Agent Frostbyte has compromised the perimeter. We know his motive: an uncontrollable, biological compulsion to consume textiles—specifically, socks. If we do not intervene, Christmas morning will be barefoot and cold.\nBut Frostbyte is a pawn. The Crown suspects he is being directed by a higher power known only as The Architect.\nThe Architect has deployed a Reality Distortion Field across your location. It has subtly warped everyday objects—lamps, books, paintings—turning them into vaults for secure data. You have looked at these objects a thousand times, but you have never truly seen them.\n\nBy order of Lord Pembroke, head of of Royal Intelligence, I am activating five sleeper agents and the Starlight Core to recover the stockings.\n\nAGENT C — CODENAME: SOURDOUGH\nProfile: Master of forensic accounting and logic.\nSpecialty: You possess the precision to bake the perfect loaf and the mind to unravel the intrigues of The Crown.
